Update as of Dec. 13th 2024:

- My working directory for the ee282 final project during this semester has been in /pub/valenp/repositories/myfirstproject since there is more memory
- In hindsight I should have made a plan for how I wanted to deal with this when it came time to pushing my work to git from ~/myrepos/ee282/ \
which I have used to turn in class assignments.
- Basically copying the /pub/valenp/repositories/myfirstproject/ straight up will use 368 GB and I only have 45 GB available in ~/myrepos/ee282/
-As a result, I have selectively copied over key data / scripts / output files from /pub/valenp/repositories/myfirstproject into final_project branch for ee282.

Update as of Nov. 13th 2024:

- homework3.md and homework3.html are available on GitHub in the ee282/homework3/ branch.
